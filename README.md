# cuda-playground

The goal of this repository is to play around with CUDA and learn actively how to use it and write custom kernels that can be used in PyTorch when doing some development of Deep Learning Models (in particular LLMs). I'm seeing this as a chance to learn more about the underlying hardware, how to optimize the code for the GPU and how to structurize good C/C++/CUDA code.
